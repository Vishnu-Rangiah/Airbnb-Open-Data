    "Here, we can see a proper correlation matrix between the variables within our dataset. According to this plot, we can see that the more lighter the color, the higher the correlation between each variable. Vice versa, we can see that the darker the number, the lower the correlation. From this plot, we can immediately see a high correlation of 0.6 between id and host_id. Along with this, it can be seen that number of reviews and reviews per month also have a higher correlation than others at 0.49. Along with positive correlations, we can also see negative correlations with id and number of reviews at -0.45 and with id and reviews per month at -0.45. We can also see a negative correlation between price and longitude at -0.3, although a positive correlation of 0.051 between price and latitude. \n",

    "As id is a specific tag per listing, host_id is also a specific tag per host. Therefore, this positive correlation does seem to make sense as some hosts would have multiple listings under their name. Number of reviews and reviews per month also tend to have a positive correlation as each number of review contributes to a review per month and vice versa, therefore these two variables seem to have a direct relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lowest correlation we can see in this plot can be seen between both variables of reviews and id. The large negative correlation between them does seem accurate, as each id is specific and randomly generated and does not relate at all to reviews at all. Another negative correlation that was interesting comes from price and longitude. As longitude tends to be west and east, it can be seen that pricein New York does not tend to have any sort of relationship with those specific directions. Although, price and latitude show a somewhat positive correlation, meaning that price is more correlated with listings that range from the north and south rather than the west and east. "
